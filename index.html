        <div class="ideas-text">
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.</p>

            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>
